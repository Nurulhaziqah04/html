  		Family is where life begins and love never ends. It’s not just about shared blood or a last name it’s about the people who stand by you, believe in you, and shape who you become. Family is your first teacher, your loudest cheerleader, and sometimes your toughest critic, all rooted in unconditional love. Through joy and hardship, success and struggle, family offers a sense of belonging and a place to return to, no matter how far you roam.
